<p>What is the process for extracting and producing stevia extract liquid drops? Stevia extract liquid drops are a popular sweetener used in a variety of foods and beverages. The process for extracting and producing these drops is quite fascinating and involves several steps to ensure the high quality of the final product. The first step in the production of stevia extract liquid drops is the cultivation of stevia plants. <br><br>  The plants are grown on farms specifically dedicated to cultivating stevia, where they are carefully tended to ensure optimal growth and leaf development. Once the stevia plants have reached maturity, typically after about one year of growth, they are harvested by hand or machine depending on the size of the operation. The leaves are then dried using a variety of methods such as air drying or freeze-drying to preserve their natural sweetness and flavor. <br><br>  This extraction can be done using either water or alcohol as solvents, with water being preferred for its more natural and environmentally friendly properties. The extracted steviol glycosides are then purified through a series of filtration and purification steps to remove any impurities or unwanted substances. This ensures that only pure, concentrated steviol glycosides remain in the final product. <br><br>  This concentrated solution is then packaged into dropper bottles or other containers for sale to consumers as stevia extract liquid drops. Overall, the process for extracting and producing stevia extract liquid drops is complex yet rewarding. It requires careful attention to detail at every step to ensure that only high-quality, natural sweeteners are produced for consumers to enjoy in their favorite foods and drinks. <br><br></p>
